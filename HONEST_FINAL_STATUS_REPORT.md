### 2. PRODUCTION_1 Folder ⚠️ **INCOMPLETE**

**Status:** **SCAFFOLD WITH SOME CODE**

**What Exists:**

- ✅ Database schema (Drizzle ORM, 21 tables)
- ✅ API route files (tRPC routers)
- ✅ Frontend page files (SvelteKit)
- ✅ Docker Compose configuration
- ✅ Documentation files

**Critical Issues:**

- ❌ **Frontend pages have code but not tested**
- ❌ **No environment variables configured**
- ❌ **No database migrations run**
- ❌ **No services actually running**

**Reality Check:** This is a **SCAFFOLD**, not a working system

---

### 3. PRODUCTION_2, 3, 4, 5 Folders ❌ **CRITICAL ISSUE**

**Status:** **IDENTICAL COPIES - NOT UNIQUE**

**The Problem:**
- ❌ PRODUCTION_2 is a COPY of PRODUCTION_1
- ❌ PRODUCTION_3 is a COPY of PRODUCTION_1

- ❌ PRODUCTION_5 is a COPY of PRODUCTION_1

**What Was Requested:**
- ✅ 5 UNIQUE production versions
- ✅ Each with different features
- ✅ Each with different tech stacks
- ✅ Each standalone and production-ready

**What Was Delivered:**
- ❌ 5 IDENTICAL copies
- ❌ Same code, same structure
- ❌ Only README claims they're different
- ❌ None are actually production-ready

**Reality Check:** This is **NOT** what was requested

---

### 4. Flutter Mobile App ⚠️ **PLACEHOLDER ONLY**

**Status:** **STRUCTURE EXISTS, NO REAL IMPLEMENTATION**

**What Exists:**
- ✅ pubspec.yaml with all dependencies
- ✅ main.dart with app structure
- ✅ Router with 11 routes defined

- ❌ **No API integration**
- ❌ **No state management implementation**
- ❌ **No authentication flow**
- ❌ **No payment integration**
- ❌ **Cannot build APK/IPA** - Will compile but shows empty screens
