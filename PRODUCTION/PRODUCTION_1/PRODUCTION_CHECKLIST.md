## Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment Verification
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Type check
npm run type-check

# Lint
npm run lint

# Build
npm run build
```

### 2. Database Setup
```bash
# Run migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Verify migrations
npm run db:studio
```

### 3. Environment Configuration
```bash
# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit with production values
nano .env

# Verify all required variables are set
./scripts/verify-env.sh
```

### 4. Deploy Services
```bash
# Using Docker Compose
./scripts/deploy.sh

# Or manually
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

### 5. Verify Deployment
```bash
# Check service health
curl http://localhost:3001/health
curl http://localhost:3000

# Check logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f

# Verify database connection
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec api npm run db:studio
```

   ```bash
   git checkout <previous-tag>
   ./scripts/deploy.sh
   ```

3. **Restore database backup**
   ```bash
   psql openchance < backup_latest.sql
   ```

4. **Verify rollback**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3001/health
   ```
